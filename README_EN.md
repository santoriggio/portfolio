## Projects

### Ongoing Project: Customer360 App

The app I'm developing allows users to interact with the Framework360 platform. It will be a powerful tool that enables Framework360's customers to provide consumers with a customized app using various available templates, including video courses, e-commerce, restaurant apps, sales agents' apps, and more. It will include 4 images related to video courses to enhance the user experience.
