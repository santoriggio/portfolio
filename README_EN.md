### Ongoing Project: Customer360 App

The app I'm developing allows users to interface with the Framework360 platform. It will be a powerful tool that will enable Framework360 customers to provide consumers with a customized app using various available templates, including Video Courses, Ecommerce, Restaurant Apps, Sales Agent Apps, and more. Below are 4 images of the "Videocourses" template currently under development.
