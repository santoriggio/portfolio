## Projects

### Projects in development: BudgetBuddy

BudgetBuddy is a personal finance management application that offers a range of advanced features. Users can create "Spaces" which are collections of transactions, each with its own summary, scheduled transactions, currencies, and detailed monthly reports. These reports can be filtered by user, category, currency, and date, allowing users to monitor and analyze their finances comprehensively and personalized.

BudgetBuddy also provides secondary features to enhance user experience. Notification management ensures users stay updated on their transactions and upcoming payments. Full synchronization across devices enables users to access their finances from anywhere and any device. Additionally, streamlined login via Google and Apple accounts simplifies the registration and access process, ensuring greater convenience and security for users.

BudgetBuddy also allows users to provide feedback directly from the application. This enables users to offer suggestions, tips, or report any issues quickly and directly, contributing to continuous improvement in the application's experience.
